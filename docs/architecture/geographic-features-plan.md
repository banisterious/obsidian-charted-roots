# Geographic Features Plan

> **Status:** Planning
> **Target Version:** TBD (post v0.5.1)

This document outlines the design for geographic/place-based features in Canvas Roots.

---

## Overview

Geographic features will enable users to:
- Create and manage place notes with hierarchical relationships
- Track where people were born, died, married, and lived
- Visualize migration patterns and geographic distributions
- Support both real-world and fictional geography

---

## Phase 1: Place Notes Foundation

### Place Note Schema

```yaml
---
type: place
cr_id: place_abc123
name: "London"
aliases:
  - "City of London"
  - "Londinium"

# Classification
place_category: real  # real | historical | disputed | legendary | mythological | fictional
universe: null        # optional, for fictional/mythological/legendary places

# Hierarchy
parent_place: "[[England]]"  # or parent_place_id: place_xyz789
place_type: city             # city, village, region, country, castle, etc.

# Real-world coordinates (for real, historical, disputed places)
coordinates:
  lat: 51.5074
  long: -0.1278

# Custom coordinates (for fictional places or custom maps)
custom_coordinates:
  x: null
  y: null
  map: null  # path to custom map image

# Historical names (place changed names over time)
historical_names:
  - name: "Londinium"
    period: "Roman"
  - name: "Lundenwic"
    period: "Anglo-Saxon"
---

# London

Notes about this place...
```

### Place Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `real` | Verified real-world location | London, New York, Tokyo |
| `historical` | Real place that no longer exists or changed significantly | Babylon, Constantinople, Tenochtitlan |
| `disputed` | Location debated by historians/archaeologists | Troy, King Solomon's Mines |
| `legendary` | May have historical basis but heavily fictionalized | Camelot, El Dorado, Shangri-La |
| `mythological` | Place from mythology/religion, not claimed to be real | Asgard, Mount Olympus, Valhalla |
| `fictional` | Invented for a story/world | Winterfell, Mordor, Gotham City |

### Default Behavior

- If `place_category` is omitted, defaults to `real`
- `universe` field only relevant for `fictional`, `mythological`, `legendary` categories
- Data quality warnings if `fictional` place has lat/long coordinates

### Person Note Integration

Person notes can reference places in two ways:

```yaml
# String-based (current, backwards compatible)
birth_place: "London, England"

# Link-based (enhanced)
birth_place: "[[London]]"
birth_place_id: place_abc123
```

## Phase 2: Place Statistics

A new section in the Control Center showing aggregate place data.

### Statistics Display

```
📍 Place Statistics

Overview
────────
Total places: 47
With coordinates: 38 (81%)
Orphan places (no parent): 3
Max hierarchy depth: 5

By Category
───────────
Real:          34 places │ 156 people
Historical:     8 places │  23 people
Fictional:     13 places │  45 people
Mythological:   4 places │  12 people
Disputed:       2 places │   6 people
Unclassified:   5 places │  18 people

Most Common Birth Places
────────────────────────
1. London, England         23
2. New York, USA           18
3. Dublin, Ireland         12
4. Unknown                  8
5. Paris, France            7

Migration Patterns (Birth → Death)
──────────────────────────────────
Ireland → USA              14
England → Australia         8
Germany → USA               6

Place Hierarchy Issues
──────────────────────
⚠ "Springfield" appears in 3 different hierarchies
⚠ "London" has no parent place defined
⚠ 5 people reference non-existent place notes
```

### Actions from Statistics Panel

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Create missing place notes | Generate notes for places referenced but not created |
| Standardize place names | Find variations and unify them |
| Build hierarchy | Wizard to assign parent places to orphans |
| View place index | Alphabetical list with person counts |
| Migration diagram | Visual showing flows between places |

---

## Phase 3: Simple Visualization

D3-based visualizations without external map dependencies.

### Schematic/Network View

- Places as nodes, connections as edges
- Size nodes by number of associated people
- Color by category or hierarchy level
- Show migration flows as directed edges

### Migration Flow Diagram

- Sankey or chord diagram showing movement between places
- Filter by time period, generation, or branch
- Aggregate by region or show individual places

---

## Phase 4: Full Map Support

### Real-World Maps

**Recommended Stack:**
- Leaflet.js (~40KB) for map rendering
- OpenStreetMap tiles (free, attribution required)
- Nominatim for geocoding (optional, rate-limited)

**Features:**
- Pin markers for birth/death locations
- Lines showing migration paths
- Cluster markers for dense areas
- Time slider to animate across generations

### Fictional/Custom Maps

**Custom Image Maps:**
- User provides map image (PNG/SVG)
- Define coordinate bounds for the image
- Place pins using pixel or custom coordinate system

**Features:**
- Same pin/path visualization as real maps
- Support multiple custom maps per universe
- Link between custom and real maps for hybrid worlds

### Feature Availability by Category

| Feature | real | historical | disputed | legendary | mythological | fictional |
|---------|------|------------|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Geocoding lookup | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| OpenStreetMap link | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Custom map support | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Universe grouping | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Historical names | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

---

## Data Quality Integration

### New Validation Rules

- Person references place that doesn't exist as a note
- Place has no parent (orphan at non-root level)
- Circular hierarchy detected
- Duplicate place names without disambiguation
- Fictional place has real-world coordinates (likely mistake)
- Real place missing coordinates
- Person born in child place, died in ancestor place (geographically odd)

---

## Implementation Questions (TBD)

1. **Place note creation**: Automatic from imports, or manual only?
2. **Hierarchy enforcement**: Strict (must link to parent) or flexible (string fallback)?
3. **Existing data migration**: How to convert `birth_place: "London, England"` strings to place note links?
4. **Settings**: Places folder location, default category, coordinate system preference

---

## Third-Party Dependencies

| Library | Purpose | Size | Required Phase |
|---------|---------|------|----------------|
| Leaflet.js | Map rendering | ~40KB | Phase 4 |
| D3-geo | SVG map projections | Already included | Phase 3 |

**External Services (Optional):**
- OpenStreetMap tiles (free, attribution required)
- Nominatim geocoding API (free, rate-limited)
