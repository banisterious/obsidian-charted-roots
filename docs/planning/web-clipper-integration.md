# Web Clipper Integration

Planning document for integrating Obsidian Web Clipper with Canvas Roots for genealogical research.

- **Status:** Ready for implementation
- **GitHub Issue:** [#128](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/128)
- **Created:** 2025-01-04
- **Updated:** 2026-01-05 (Phase 1 decisions finalized based on community feedback)
- **Enabled By:** [#137](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/137) (Staging Management UI, completed v0.18.24)

---

## Overview

Obsidian Web Clipper is an official browser extension that captures web content into Obsidian notes. With the Staging Management UI now complete, users can already configure Web Clipper to output to their staging folder and use Staging Manager to review/promote clipped notes. This integration adds convenience features and (eventually) standardized templates.

### Goals

1. **Streamline clipped note detection** — Auto-detect clipped notes and show Dashboard indicator
2. **Leverage existing staging workflow** — Enhance the clip → stage → review → promote workflow
3. **Enable community experimentation** — Let users test templates before standardization
4. **Eventually provide curated templates** — After learning from community usage

### Non-Goals

- Building a custom web scraper (Web Clipper handles extraction)
- Modifying Web Clipper itself (we provide integration only)
- Real-time sync with genealogy websites
- Opinionated auto-import (staging review workflow is more flexible)

---

## Phase 1: File Watcher & Dashboard Integration

**Status:** Ready to implement (enabled by #137)

Detect clipped notes and provide convenience features for the existing workflow.

### Clipper Metadata Properties

To detect clipped notes, users should include one or more of these properties in their Web Clipper templates:

- `clip_source_type` - Type of source (e.g., `obituary`, `findagrave`, `census`)
- `clipped_from` - Original URL (`{{url}}` in Web Clipper)
- `clipped_date` - Clip timestamp (`{{date}}` in Web Clipper)

Canvas Roots will monitor staging folder for files containing these properties.

### User Workflow

1. User creates their own Web Clipper templates (or obtains from community)
2. Configure Web Clipper to output to staging folder (e.g., `Family/Staging/clips`)
3. Include `clip_source_type` or `clipped_from` in template frontmatter
4. Clip genealogical content from web
5. Canvas Roots detects new clips and shows Dashboard indicator: "3 new clipped notes"
6. Click indicator to open Staging Manager filtered to clipped notes
7. Review and promote to main tree

### Implementation Steps

1. **File watching:**
   - Use `vault.on('create', ...)` to detect new files in staging folder
   - Parse frontmatter for clipper metadata properties
   - Track count of unreviewed clipped notes

2. **Dashboard integration:**
   - Add "Clipped Notes" indicator (similar to existing staging indicator)
   - Show count: "3 new"
   - Click opens Staging Manager with filter: `clip_source_type:*` or `clipped_from:*`

3. **Staging Manager filter:**
   - Add filter option: "Clipped notes only"
   - Shows files with clipper metadata
   - Optionally persist filter selection

### Implementation Details & Decisions

**Dashboard indicator approach:**
- Dashboard indicator only for Phase 1 (simpler, less intrusive)
- No notices/notifications for clip detection
- Rationale: Less intrusive, user checks when ready; simpler MVP implementation

**Filter persistence:**
- No persistence initially
- Staging currently contains imports and clippings; simple approach should suffice
- Can add persistence later if users accumulate large backlogs over extended periods

**Unreviewed tracking:**
- Count resets when Staging Manager opens (simple approach)
- Anything in staging is inherently unprocessed
- Count indicates "new clips since you last checked staging"
- Can enhance with per-file tracking if users request it

**Detection scope:**
- Only monitor staging folder (as configured in settings)
- Prevents performance issues from scanning entire vault
- User must configure Web Clipper to output to staging folder
- Clips outside staging folder won't be detected

**Property standardization:**
- All three properties recommended but optional: `clip_source_type`, `clipped_from`, `clipped_date`
- Minimal standardization makes implementation easier
- Document benefits of including properties and what's lost without them
- Gives users flexibility while enabling better integration
- Properties are unprefixed for simplicity (low risk of conflict)

**Filter mechanism:**
- Extend existing Staging Manager search/filter to support property matching
- Simple text match on property names initially
- Can enhance with property-specific UI later

**Dashboard indicator placement:**
- Hybrid approach: Dedicated card shown only when clipped notes exist
- Card appears dynamically when clips detected, hidden when staging cleared
- Rationale: Clean Dashboard for non-clippers, prominent when relevant, room for future features
- Layout shift acts as visual feedback for clip detection
- Can be smoothed with animation in implementation

### Benefits

- Works with any user-created templates (no repo commitment needed)
- Users can experiment and share templates in Discussions
- Minimal implementation effort (leverage existing Staging Manager UI)
- Learn from real usage before standardizing templates

---

## Phase 2: Official Template Distribution (Future)

**Status:** After community feedback

Provide curated, tested templates based on real-world usage patterns.

### Rationale for Delay

- Let users experiment with their own templates first
- Learn what sources are actually used (Find A Grave? Ancestry? Newspapers?)
- Understand which extraction methods work best (LLM vs CSS selectors)
- Avoid committing to templates that may need frequent updates
- Reduce initial maintenance burden

### When to Proceed

Consider moving forward when:
- Multiple users sharing similar templates in Discussions
- Clear patterns emerge for most-used sources
- Web Clipper API/schema stabilizes
- Community requests official templates

### Proposed Template Location

**docs/clipper-templates/** in main repo with:
- Individual JSON files for each template
- README with setup instructions and compatibility notes
- Version compatibility metadata (`canvas_roots_min_version`)

### Candidate Templates

Based on initial community interest:

| Template | Source | Extraction Method | Priority |
|----------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Generic Obituary | Any obituary site | LLM extraction | High |
| Find A Grave | findagrave.com | CSS selectors | High |
| FamilySearch Person | familysearch.org | CSS selectors | Medium |
| Wikipedia Biography | wikipedia.org | Schema.org | Low |

### Template Standards

When/if official templates are created:
- Use canonical Canvas Roots property names
- Include all clipper metadata properties (`clip_source_type`, `clipped_from`, `clipped_date`)
- Document property mappings and known limitations
- Include URL triggers for auto-selection
- Test against real pages before release
- Version templates alongside plugin releases

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Extraction (Future)

**Status:** Conceptual

More sophisticated extraction capabilities.

### Potential Features

- **Relationship extraction** — Parse "survived by" sections in obituaries
- **Multi-person clipping** — Extract family group from census page
- **Source linking** — Auto-create source note linked to clipped person
- **Place standardization** — Normalize place names during extraction

### Research Needed

- Web Clipper's LLM extraction capabilities and limits
- Schema.org markup availability on genealogy sites
- CSS selector stability on target sites

## Notes

This plan was created based on GitHub issue [#128](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/128) discussion. Key community input:

**Initial testing (@wilbry):**
- Web Clipper requires double quotes in prompts (not single quotes)
- Clipper variables in context field improve LLM extraction quality
- Larger Mistral models (8B, Small 3.2) perform better than smaller models
- LLM hallucination observed (fabricating birth years when not in source)
- Hallucination issue reinforces value of staging review workflow

**Phase 1 design decisions (@wilbry feedback):**
- Dashboard indicator only for simpler MVP
- No filter persistence initially (staging volume expected to be manageable)
- Reset unreviewed count when Staging Manager opens
- Staging folder detection only (performance and simplicity)
- All three clipper properties recommended but optional
