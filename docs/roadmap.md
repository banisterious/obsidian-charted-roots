## 🚧 In Active Development

### Import Cleanup - Phase 1: Staging Workflow

**Status**: 🔨 In Progress

See [import-cleanup-plan.md](architecture/import-cleanup-plan.md) for detailed implementation plan.

**Current Phase Goals:**
- Dedicated staging folder setting (auto-excluded from normal operations)
- Import destination toggle (main vs staging) in Control Center
- Staging folder isolation from tree generation, duplicate detection, etc.

---

## 📋 Planned Features

### Folder Filtering

**Status**: ✅ Complete (v0.4.0)

Control which folders Canvas Roots scans for person notes. Useful for mixed-use vaults or complex organizational structures.

**Implemented Features:**
- **Exclusion list**: Ignore specific folders (e.g., templates, archive, non-genealogy notes)
- **Inclusion list**: Alternative mode - only scan specified folders
- Settings UI with dropdown for filter mode and textarea for folder list
- Case-insensitive path matching for cross-platform compatibility

**Applies to:**
- Person note detection (FamilyGraphService)
- Duplicate detection scope
- Tree generation scans
- Validation commands
- Relationship sync scope
- Vault statistics
- All import/export operations

See [folder-filtering-plan.md](architecture/folder-filtering-plan.md) for implementation details.

### Import Cleanup & Consolidation

**Status**: 🔨 Phase 1 In Progress

Tools for consolidating multiple GEDCOM files, cleaning up messy imports, and improving data quality. Addresses the common scenario of having multiple old, overlapping GEDCOM files from various sources.

**Phase 1 - Staging Workflow:**
- Dedicated staging folder setting (auto-excluded from normal operations)
- Import preview showing what will be created before committing
- "Promote to main" action to move cleaned data to person folder
- Delete/archive staging data without affecting main tree
- Staging folder isolated from: tree generation, duplicate detection, relationship sync, collections

**Phase 2 - Cross-Import Duplicate Detection:**
- Detect duplicates between staging and existing data before import
- Detect duplicates across multiple staged imports
- Side-by-side comparison view for potential matches
- "Same person" / "Different people" resolution actions
- Source file tracking (which GEDCOM contributed which data)

**Phase 3 - Merge & Consolidation Tools:**
- Merge wizard for combining duplicate records
- Field-level conflict resolution (choose which source's date/place/etc.)
- Combine unique data from multiple sources into one record
- Relationship reconciliation when merging people with different connections
- Audit trail showing merge decisions

**Phase 4 - Data Quality Tools:**
- Data quality report: missing dates, orphaned records, incomplete relationships
- Batch operations: normalize name formats, standardize date formats
- "Fill in blanks" suggestions based on related records
- Inconsistency detection (e.g., child born before parent)
- Completeness scoring per person

**Use Cases:**
- Consolidating overlapping trees from multiple family researchers
- Extracting useful branches from large, chaotic GEDCOM files
- Cleaning up data accumulated over years from various sources
- Quality assurance before sharing or publishing

**Isolation Strategy:**

The staging workflow requires clear separation from "production" data:

*Default mode (simple):*
- Single staging folder setting, auto-excluded from all normal operations
- Main person folder + staging folder = complete isolation
- Zero configuration beyond setting the staging path

*Opt-in project mode (advanced):*
- Enable "project-based organization" in settings
- Define named projects, each with own person folder(s) and optional staging
- Project switcher in Control Center
- Commands scoped to active project
- Use case: multiple family research projects in one vault, each fully isolated

Both modes use Folder Filtering as the underlying mechanism.

**Example Workflow:**

Scenario: User has clean tree in `/People/` (200 notes), wants to process three old messy GEDCOMs.

1. **Setup**: Configure staging folder (`/People-Staging/`) in settings
2. **Import to staging**: Import each GEDCOM to separate subfolders (`import-1/`, `import-2/`, `import-3/`)
3. **Clean within staging**:
   - Run duplicate detection scoped to staging only
   - Merge/delete internal duplicates across imports
   - Review data quality report, fix issues in Bases
   - Generate preview trees to visualize structure
   - Delete obvious junk records
4. **Compare staging to main**:
   - Run "Compare staging to main tree" command
   - Review potential matches side-by-side
   - Mark each as "Same person" or "Different people"
5. **Merge/promote**:
   - For matches: merge wizard combines data with field-level conflict resolution
   - For new people: "Promote to main" moves to `/People/`
   - Relationships updated automatically
6. **Cleanup**: Archive remaining staging data, run validation on main tree

**Operation Scopes:**

| Operation | Default Scope |
|-----------|---------------|
| Tree generation | Main only |
| Normal duplicate detection | Main only |
| Relationship sync | Main only |
| Collections/groups | Main only |
| "Compare staging to main" | Cross-boundary (explicit) |
| "Find duplicates in staging" | Staging only (explicit) |
| Data quality report | Configurable |

**Tracked Metadata:**
- `_source_file`: which GEDCOM this person originated from
- `_import_date`: when the record was imported
- Enables informed conflict resolution and audit trail

**Open Questions:**
- How to handle conflicting data when merging (UI/UX for resolution)?
- Should source tracking be per-field or per-person?
- Integration with existing duplicate detection vs. new system?
- Project mode: how much configuration per project? (settings, color schemes, etc.)

### Reference Numbering Systems

**Status**: ✅ Completed in v0.2.8

Genealogical numbering systems for systematic identification of ancestors and descendants. Numbers stored in YAML frontmatter properties, automatically available in Bases views.

**Implemented Systems:**
- ✅ **Ahnentafel** (ancestor numbering): Self=1, Father=2, Mother=3, paternal grandfather=4, etc. Pattern: person N's father=2N, mother=2N+1
- ✅ **d'Aboville** (descendant numbering): Root=1, children=1.1/1.2/1.3, grandchildren=1.1.1/1.1.2, etc. Dots indicate generations, numbers show birth order
- ✅ **Henry System** (compact descendant): Similar to d'Aboville without dots (1, 11, 12, 111, 112...)
- ✅ **Generation numbering**: 0=self, -1=parents, -2=grandparents, +1=children, etc.

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Commands for each numbering system (command palette)
- ✅ Context menu on person notes with submenu for all systems
- ✅ "Clear reference numbers" command to remove specific numbering type
- ✅ GEDCOM import integration ("Assign reference numbers" button in import results)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly flat menu structure

**Storage:**
- `ahnentafel` property in frontmatter (integer)
- `daboville` property in frontmatter (string, e.g., "1.2.3")
- `henry` property in frontmatter (string, e.g., "123")
- `generation` property in frontmatter (integer, negative for ancestors)
- Automatically visible in Bases views (users opt-in by adding column)

### Advanced UI

**Status**: ⏸️ Low Priority - Superseded by existing features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Person Detail Panel | Low priority | Largely redundant with Bases table views and opening notes directly |
| Rich inline person display | Low priority | Bases provides this; Family Chart View would do it better |
| Quick editing | Low priority | Bases inline editing covers this use case |
| Canvas export as image/PDF | ✅ Completed | PNG/SVG/PDF export in Family Chart View and Tree Preview (v0.3.1) |

The "relationship visualization" aspect originally planned for Person Detail Panel is better served by the **Interactive Family Chart View**, which provides full tree context rather than just immediate relatives.

### Interactive Family Chart View

**Status**: ✅ Completed in v0.3.0

A dedicated Obsidian leaf view that renders the full family-chart library interactively, complementing the static canvas output. Leverages the complete [family-chart](https://github.com/donatso/family-chart) API for rich genealogical visualization.

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Persistent leaf view (sidebar, new tab, or split pane)
- ✅ Full family-chart interactivity: pan, zoom, click-to-focus, smooth animated transitions
- ✅ Bidirectional sync with markdown notes (chart edits update frontmatter, frontmatter changes reflect in chart)
- ✅ Click node to open person note in editor
- ✅ Edit mode with inline relationship editing and undo/redo support
- ✅ Multiple color schemes: Gender, Generation, Collection, Monochrome
- ✅ Export as PNG, SVG, PDF with customizable filenames (v0.3.1)
- ✅ Toolbar UI: layout, color scheme, zoom, history, search
- ✅ Command: "Open family chart view", "Open current note in family chart"
- ✅ Context menu integration on person notes

**Potential Future Enhancements:**
- Multiple chart views open simultaneously (different root persons)
- Linked views that stay synchronized
- Custom card components with Obsidian-specific actions
- Info popup integration showing person note preview
- Kinship labels display mode

### Privacy & Obfuscation

**Status**: ✅ Partially Completed in v0.2.9

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Living person privacy controls for GEDCOM exports
- ✅ Configurable birth year threshold (default: 100 years)
- ✅ Settings: `enableGedcomPrivacy`, `livingPersonThreshold`

**Planned:**
- Optional data obfuscation for canvas display
- PII protection for notes/canvas (beyond GEDCOM export)
- Configurable obfuscation rules for different export types

### Batch Operations

- ✅ "Generate all family trees" folder action (Completed v0.2.9)
- ✅ Batch tree generation with progress tracking (Completed v0.2.9)
- ✅ Folder-level statistics and health reports (Completed v0.2.9)

### Canvas Navigation & Organization

- Most common names, occupations, places
- Generation gap analysis (parent age at child birth)
- Marriage patterns (age differences, remarriage frequency)
- Timeline views: "Who was alive in [year]?" queries
- Historical event correlation

### Smart Duplicate Detection

**Status**: ✅ Partially Completed in v0.3.3

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Find potential duplicate people by name similarity and date proximity
- ✅ Fuzzy matching for name variations (Levenshtein distance)
- ✅ Confidence scoring with configurable thresholds
- ✅ Command: "Find duplicate people" with modal UI

**Planned:**

### Geographic Features

- Place name standardization and geocoding
- Map view showing birth/death locations
- Migration pattern visualization
- Place hierarchy (City → County → State → Country)
- Location-based filtering and analysis
- Historical place name support

### Research Tracking

- Mark people as "needs research" with specific to-dos
- Track confidence levels for relationships (verified, probable, possible)
- Source documentation per fact (birth date source, death place source)
- Research progress indicators in Bases views
- DNA match tracking and ethnicity data
- "DNA confirmed" relationship tagging

### Interactive Canvas Features

**Status**: ⏸️ Reconsidered - See Interactive Family Chart View

Most interactive canvas features are not feasible with Obsidian's current Canvas API, which lacks programmatic viewport control and event hooks. The Canvas is designed as a user-manipulated workspace, not a programmatically-controlled visualization.

| Feature | Feasibility | Issue |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Hover tooltips | 🟡 Hacky | No official API; requires fragile DOM manipulation |
| Minimap | 🔴 Difficult | No viewport state access |
| Zoom to person | 🔴 Difficult | No programmatic viewport control |
| Highlight paths | 🟡 Hacky | Edge SVG manipulation possible but fragile |
| Collapsible branches | 🔴 Very difficult | Would require hide/show plus layout recalculation |
| Click-to-focus | 🔴 Difficult | Same viewport control limitation |

**Recommended Alternative**: The **Interactive Family Chart View** (see above) provides all these features natively by rendering family-chart directly in a dedicated Obsidian leaf view, bypassing Canvas API limitations entirely. Canvas remains valuable for static, printable output with Obsidian-native file linking.

### Alternative Layout Algorithms

- ✅ **Compact layout** - 50% tighter spacing for large trees (v0.2.3-beta)
- ✅ **Timeline layout** - Chronological positioning by birth year (v0.2.3-beta)
- ✅ **Hourglass layout** - Ancestors above, descendants below root person (v0.2.3-beta)
- Fan chart (circular ancestor view) - Deferred due to Canvas rectangular node constraints
- Bow-tie layout for showing connections between families

### Dynasty Management

- Succession tracking (line of succession calculator)
- Title/position inheritance
- Royal/noble house visualization
- Coat of arms and heraldry support
- Regnal numbering (King Henry VIII, etc.)
- Crown succession rules (primogeniture, ultimogeniture, etc.)

### Faction Relationships

- Alliance and conflict tracking between groups
- Political marriage networks
- Power structure hierarchies
- Faction-based coloring and visualization
- Inter-faction relationship mapping

### Import/Export Enhancements

**Status**: ✅ Partially Completed in v0.3.3

**Implemented:**
- ✅ CSV bulk import/export (v0.3.3)
- ✅ Selective export - specific branches only (v0.3.3)
- ✅ Privacy filters for living people (v0.2.9 for GEDCOM export)

**Planned:**
- FamilySearch GEDCOM X format support
- Gramps XML import
- Redacted exports for sharing
