# Staging & Cleanup

This page covers tools for managing imported data quality: staging workflows, duplicate detection, and record merging.

## Smart Duplicate Detection

Find potential duplicate person records in your vault using intelligent matching algorithms. This helps maintain data quality, especially after importing data from multiple sources.

### How It Works

Smart Duplicate Detection analyzes your person notes using multiple criteria:

**Fuzzy Name Matching (Levenshtein Distance):**
- Compares names allowing for typos and spelling variations
- "John Smith" matches "Jon Smith" or "John Smyth"
- Handles reversed names ("Smith, John" vs "John Smith")
- Configurable similarity threshold

**Date Proximity Analysis:**
- Compares birth and death dates when available
- Allows configurable year tolerance (default: ±2 years)
- Missing dates don't disqualify matches

**Confidence Scoring:**
Each potential duplicate receives a confidence level:
- **High**: Strong name match + close dates (likely duplicates)
- **Medium**: Good name match, dates may differ slightly
- **Low**: Possible match, worth reviewing

### Finding Duplicates

**Via Command Palette:**
1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + P`
2. Type "Canvas Roots: Find duplicate people"
3. The detection modal opens with results

**What You'll See:**
- List of potential duplicate pairs grouped by confidence
- Name comparison showing both versions
- Birth/death dates for each person (if available)
- Match score and confidence level

### Reviewing Matches

For each potential duplicate pair:

**Confirm as Duplicate:**
- Opens both notes for manual review
- Decide which record to keep
- Merge data as needed

**Dismiss False Positive:**
- Marks the pair as "not duplicates"
- Won't appear in future scans
- Dismissals are remembered across sessions

### Configuring Detection

Adjust detection sensitivity in Settings → Canvas Roots → Data:

**Name Similarity Threshold:**
- Higher values = stricter matching (fewer false positives)
- Lower values = looser matching (catches more variations)
- Default: 0.8 (80% similarity required)

**Date Tolerance:**
- Years of variance allowed for date matching
- Default: 2 years
- Set to 0 for exact date matching only

### Best Practices

**When to Run Detection:**
- After importing GEDCOM or CSV files
- After bulk data entry sessions
- Periodically during research to catch accidental duplicates

**Handling Duplicates:**
1. Review both notes side-by-side
2. Identify which has more complete data
3. Merge unique information into the keeper
4. Update relationships pointing to the duplicate
5. Delete or archive the duplicate note

**Preventing Duplicates:**
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Enable bidirectional sync to catch relationship conflicts
- Import from single authoritative source when possible

## Staging & Import Cleanup

The staging workflow provides a safe way to process imported data before incorporating it into your main family tree. This is particularly useful when working with messy GEDCOM files, multiple overlapping imports, or data that needs cleanup.

### Setting Up Staging

**From Control Center (Recommended):**
1. Open Control Center → **Import/Export** tab
2. Expand the **Configure folders** section at the top
3. Set your **People folder** (where main tree notes live)
4. Set a **Staging folder** path (e.g., `People-Staging`)
5. Enable **Staging isolation** to exclude staging from normal operations

**From Plugin Settings:**
1. Go to **Settings → Canvas Roots → Data**
2. Set a **Staging folder** path
3. Enable **Staging isolation**

When staging is configured, imported data is kept separate from your main tree until you're ready to promote it.

### Importing to Staging

1. Open Control Center → **Import/Export** tab
2. Select **Format** (GEDCOM or CSV) and **Direction** (Import)
3. Select **Import destination**: choose "Staging" instead of "Main tree"
4. Optionally specify a **Subfolder name** for this import batch (e.g., `smith-gedcom-2024`)
5. Import your GEDCOM or CSV file
6. Data is created in the staging folder, isolated from your main tree

### Managing Staged Imports

The **Import/Export** tab in Control Center includes a staging area section when staging is configured:

**Subfolder Management:**
- View all import batches with person counts and dates
- Expand subfolders to see individual files
- Delete subfolders you no longer need

**Cross-Import Detection:**
- Click "Review matches with main tree" to find potential duplicates
- Compare staging records against your main tree
- Mark matches as "Same person" or "Different people"

**Promote Actions:**
- **Promote subfolder**: Move all files from a subfolder to your main people folder
- **Promote all**: Move all staging files to main
- Files marked as "same person" (duplicates) are skipped during promote—use merge instead

### Staging Isolation

When staging is enabled, staged files are automatically excluded from:
- Tree generation (your trees only show main tree data)
- Normal duplicate detection
- Relationship sync operations
- Collections and groups
- Vault statistics

This ensures your production data stays clean while you work on imports.

### Workflow Example

1. Import `smith-family.ged` to staging subfolder `smith-2024`
2. Import `jones-tree.ged` to staging subfolder `jones-2024`
3. In Import/Export tab, click "Review matches with main tree"
4. For each match, decide: Same person → Merge, or Different people → will be promoted
5. Click "Promote subfolder" for each batch
6. New unique people are moved to main; duplicates were merged earlier

## Merging Duplicate Records

When you find duplicate person records—either through duplicate detection or cross-import review—the Merge Wizard helps you combine them with field-level control.

### Accessing the Merge Wizard

**From Duplicate Detection:**
1. Run command "Find duplicate people"
2. For each potential duplicate, click **Merge**

**From Cross-Import Review:**
1. Open Import/Export tab → click "Review matches with main tree"
2. Click "Same person" for a match
3. Click the **Merge** button that appears

### Using the Merge Wizard

The Merge Wizard shows a side-by-side comparison of both records:

**Field Comparison Table:**
- Each row shows one field (name, birth date, etc.)
- **Staging** column: value from the staging/source record
- **Main** column: value from the main/target record
- **Use** column: dropdown to choose which value to keep

**Field Choices:**
- **Main**: Keep the main record's value
- **Staging**: Use the staging record's value
- **Both** (for arrays): Combine values from both (spouses, children)

Fields that are identical show a checkmark instead of a dropdown.

### Preview and Execute

1. Click **Preview** to see what the merged record will look like
2. Review the combined data
3. Click **Merge** to execute

**What Happens:**
- The main record is updated with your selected field values
- The staging record is deleted
- All relationships pointing to the staging record are updated to point to main
- A success notification confirms the merge

### Relationship Reconciliation

When merging, Canvas Roots automatically updates relationship references:

- If the staging person was listed as someone's father, that reference updates to the main person
- Spouse and child relationships are similarly updated
- This ensures no orphaned relationship references remain

### Best Practices

**Before Merging:**
- Review both records carefully
- Check if the staging record has data the main record lacks
- Consider using "Both" for array fields to preserve all relationships

**After Merging:**
- The staging file is deleted automatically
- Check the main record to verify the merge result
- Regenerate any canvases that included either person
