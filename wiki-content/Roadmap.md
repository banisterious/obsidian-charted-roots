## Planned Features

### Data Enhancement Pass

**Summary:** Upgrade existing vaults by creating missing linked entities from person note data. For users who imported GEDCOM before sources, events, and places were supported.

**Use Cases:**
1. Imported GEDCOM before v0.10.0 (no event notes)
2. Imported GEDCOM before v0.9.0 (no source notes)
3. Have person notes with place strings instead of wikilinks
4. Want to retroactively create event notes from existing date fields

**Planned Features:**
- Generate Events from Dates: Scan person notes, create event notes, link to persons
- Generate Place Notes: Extract unique place strings, create hierarchy, update wikilinks
- Re-parse GEDCOM for Sources: Match individuals to existing notes, extract `SOUR` records
- Preview mode before committing changes
- New card in Import/Export tab: "Enhance existing data"

---

### Flexible Note Type Detection

**Summary:** Support multiple methods for identifying Canvas Roots note types, avoiding conflicts with other plugins that use the `type` property.

**Problem:**
- Canvas Roots uses `type: person` to identify note types
- Other plugins use `type` for different purposes
- Some users prefer tags (`#person`) over frontmatter properties

**Planned Features:**
- New default property: `cr_type` (namespaced to avoid conflicts)
- Detection priority: `cr_type` → `type` → Tags → Property alias
- Tag-based detection: `#person`, `#place`, `#event`, `#source` (and nested tags)
- Backwards compatibility for existing vaults

---

### Type Customization

**Summary:** Allow users to customize the appearance of built-in types (relationship types, source types, event types, etc.) including icons, display names, and colors.

**Problem:**
- Built-in types have hardcoded icons, colors, and display names
- Users may want terminology that matches their domain
- Value aliases map terminology but don't allow visual customization

**Planned Features:**
- Per-type customization of display name, icon, and color
- Support for: relationship types, event types, source types, organization types, place categories
- Integration with tree generation, timeline, and Control Center

**Future Enhancement:**
- Full type editor to add/edit/delete types entirely

---

### Print & PDF Export

**Summary:** Generate print-ready and PDF outputs of family trees and reports.

**Export Types:**
- Pedigree Chart (ancestor-focused, 4-5 generations per page)
- Descendant Chart
- Family Group Sheet (single family with sources)
- Full Tree Poster (large format)

**Features:**
- Page size presets (Letter, A4, custom, poster)
- Multi-page output with page breaks
- Privacy filter (exclude/anonymize living persons)
- SVG and high-resolution PNG export

---

### Research & Analysis Tools

**Family Statistics Dashboard:**
- Longevity analysis by generation/period
- Geographic distribution maps
- Most common names, occupations, places
- Generation gap analysis
- Marriage patterns

**Research Tracking:**
- "Needs research" tags with to-dos
- Confidence levels: verified, probable, possible
- Source documentation per fact
- DNA match tracking

**Dynasty Management:**
- Line of succession calculator
- Title/position inheritance
- Regnal numbering

---

### Transcript Nodes & Oral History

**Summary:** Time-stamped citations from audio/video with direct linking.

**Schema:**
```yaml
oral_facts:
  - media: "[[Interview with Grandma.mp3]]"
    timestamp: "1m30s"
    fact_type: birth_date
    quote: "I was born on May 15th, 1922"
```

**Features:**
- Deep links with timestamp: `[[Interview.mp3]]#t=1m30s`
- Range support: `#t=1m30s-2m15s`
- One-click playback from timestamp
- Transcript nodes with speech bubble styling on canvas

**Interview Subject Graph:**
- Map relationship structure of interviews
- Interview as central hub node
- Edge thickness indicates mention frequency

---

## Future Considerations

These features are under consideration but not yet prioritized.

### Sensitive Field Redaction

Automatically redact sensitive personal information (SSN, identity numbers) from exports, regardless of living/deceased status. Currently, sensitive fields imported via GEDCOM v2 are stored but should never appear in exports.

### Flatten Nested Properties

Add a "Flatten" action to nested property warnings in Data Quality tab. Converts `coordinates: { lat, long }` to `coordinates_lat`, `coordinates_long`.

### Note Creation from Images

Context menu actions to create map or source notes from image files, pre-populating with image link.

### Person Note Templates

Pre-configured templates for different use cases: Researcher (full fields with sources), Casual User (minimal), World-Builder (with universe/fictional dates), Quick Add (bare minimum).

### Accessibility

- Screen reader support with ARIA labels
- High contrast mode
- Keyboard navigation
- WCAG AA compliance

### Obsidian Publish Support

Static HTML/SVG tree generation for Publish sites with privacy-aware export.

## Known Limitations

See [known-limitations.md](known-limitations.md) for complete details.

**Key Limitations:**
- Single vault only (no multi-vault merging)
- No undo/redo for Bases edits (platform limitation)
- No bulk operations from Bases multi-select (platform limitation)
- Privacy obfuscation for canvas display not yet implemented
- Interactive Canvas features limited by Obsidian Canvas API

### Context Menu Submenu Behavior

On desktop, submenus don't dismiss when hovering over a different submenu. This is a limitation of Obsidian's native `Menu` API. Potential solutions (flattening menus, modal dialogs, custom menu component) are under consideration based on user feedback.
