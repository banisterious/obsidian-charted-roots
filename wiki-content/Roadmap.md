## Planned Features

Features are prioritized to complete the data lifecycle: **import → enhance → export/share**.

| Priority | Label | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| ⚡ High | Core workflow | Completes essential data portability |
| 📋 Medium | User value | Highly requested sharing/output features |
| 💡 Low | Specialized | Advanced use cases, niche workflows |

---

### Create Person Enhancements

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — Continuous family creation workflow

**Status:** Planning

**The Problem:** Building a family tree from scratch requires constant jumping in and out of modals. Create person, save, close, create another, save, close, go back and link them, save, close... endlessly.

**Goal:** Enable continuous family creation without leaving the modal flow.

**Phase 1: Inline Person Creation**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| "Create new" in pickers | When selecting father/mother/spouse/child, offer "Create new person" option |
| Sub-modal creation | Opens simplified create form, returns to parent modal with link |
| Smart defaults | Pre-fill sex for parents, pre-fill relationships for children/spouses |

**Phase 2: Children Section in Edit Modal**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Children picker | Multi-select person picker to view/manage children |
| Inline creation | Create new children directly (builds on Phase 1) |
| Auto-detection | Infer `father`/`mother` field from parent's `sex` |

**Phase 3: "Add Another" Flow (Future)**

After creating a person, offer quick actions: "Add spouse", "Add child", "Add parent", "Done" — keeping users in a family-building flow.

**Phase 4: Family Creation Wizard (Future)**

Dedicated wizard for creating an entire nuclear family at once with a guided step-by-step flow.

**Documentation:**
- See [Create Person Enhancements Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/create-person-enhancements.md) for detailed specifications

---

### Event Person Property Consolidation

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — Schema simplification for events

**Status:** Planning

**The Problem:** Event notes currently use two different properties to track participants:
- `person` (string): Single participant for individual events (birth, death, occupation)
- `persons` (array): Multiple participants for family events (marriage, divorce, residence)

This duality creates complexity in base templates (requires formula workarounds), importers (must decide which property to use), and user understanding.

**Goal:** Consolidate to a single `persons` array property that works for all events.

**Phased Implementation:**

| Phase | Feature | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Update Importers | Gramps and GEDCOM importers always use `persons` array |
| 2 | Update Base Templates | Simplify formula now that all events use `persons` |
| 3 | Migration Tool | Cleanup wizard step to migrate `person` → `persons` |
| 4 | Documentation | Update Frontmatter Reference, add migration notes |

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Base templates continue reading both properties during transition
- Migration is opt-in via cleanup wizard

**Documentation:**
- See [Event Person Property Consolidation Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/event-person-property-consolidation.md) for detailed specifications

---

### Cleanup Wizard Phase 4

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — UX polish and customization for the Post-Import Cleanup Wizard

**Status:** Planning | Depends on v0.17.0 completion

**Summary:** User experience refinements for the Post-Import Cleanup Wizard. These enhancements improve accessibility, allow workflow customization, and add visual polish without changing core functionality.

**Planned Features:**

| Task | Feature | Value |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Batch Progress Indicators | Progress bars for large batch operations (Steps 2-6, 10) |
| 2 | Keyboard Navigation | Arrow keys, Enter/Escape, number shortcuts for accessibility |
| 3 | Step Reordering | Drag-drop tiles with dependency validation |
| 4 | Cleanup Profiles | Save/load named configurations (Full, Quick, Places Only) |
| 5 | Step Transition Animations | Smooth tile expansion, slide transitions, staggered results |
| 6 | Schema Integration | Hook into future schema validation system |

**Implementation Order:**
1. Batch progress indicators (high priority, UX improvement for large vaults)
2. Keyboard navigation (high priority, accessibility)
3. Animations (quick UX win)
4. Cleanup profiles (power user feature)
5. Step reordering (complex, may not be needed if profiles suffice)
6. Schema integration (deferred until schema validation exists)

**Documentation:**
- See [Cleanup Wizard Phase 4 Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/cleanup-wizard-phase4.md) for detailed specifications

---

### Gramps Notes & Family Integration

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — Preserve research notes and family structure from Gramps imports

**Status:** Planning

**Summary:** Import notes attached to Gramps entities and potentially introduce a Family entity type. Gramps treats notes and families as first-class entities with rich metadata. This feature ensures that data is preserved when importing into Canvas Roots, with optional advanced features for users who need them.

**Design Principles:**
- Start conservatively with embedded notes (appended to entity content)
- Advanced features (separate note files, Family entity, sync) are opt-in
- Preserve all Gramps metadata in frontmatter for future use and round-tripping
- Don't complicate the experience for users with simpler requirements

**Phased Implementation:**

| Phase | Feature | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Embedded person notes | Enabled |
| 2 | Other entity notes (events, places) | Enabled |
| 3 | Family entity type | Opt-in |
| 4 | Separate note files | Opt-in |
| 5 | Export & sync back to Gramps | Future |

**Privacy Handling:**
- Gramps notes can be marked private (`priv="1"`)
- Phase 1: Add `private: true` to frontmatter; user configures sync/publish exclusions
- Future: Optional separate folder for private content, or skip private notes entirely

**Documentation:**
- See [Gramps Notes & Family Integration Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/gramps-notes-family-integration.md) for detailed specifications

### Research Level Property

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — Simple property with high research planning value

**Status:** Planning

**Summary:** Add a `research_level` property to Person notes to track research progress toward GPS-compliant documentation. Based on Yvette Hoitink's "Six Levels of Ancestral Profiles" system, this provides a simple way to identify which ancestors need more research.

**Research Levels:**

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Unidentified | Ancestor exists but no name established (placeholder) |
| 1 | Name Only | Name known, appears in others' records, no vital dates |
| 2 | Vital Statistics | Birth, marriage, death dates researched |
| 3 | Life Events | Occupations, residences, children, spouses documented |
| 4 | Extended Records | Property, military, religion, legal records researched |
| 5 | GPS Complete | Exhaustive research complete, written proof summary exists |
| 6 | Biography | Full narrative biography with historical context |

**Phased Implementation:**

| Phase | Feature | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Property Support | Add `research_level` to Person frontmatter schema |
| 2 | Edit Modal | Add research level selector to Edit Person modal |
| 3 | Research Gaps Report | Filter/sort by research level, show statistics |
| 4 | Canvas Visualization | Optional color-coding of tree nodes by research level |

Phases 1-2 ship together as minimum viable feature. Phase 3 adds significant value for research prioritization. Phase 4 is an optional enhancement.

**Documentation:**
- See [Research Level Property Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/research-level-property.md) for detailed specifications
- Based on [Hoitink's Six Levels of Ancestral Profiles](https://www.dutchgenealogy.nl/six-levels-ancestral-profiles/)

### Universe Management Enhancements

**Priority:** 💡 Low — Advanced features for power users

**Status:** ✅ Core implementation complete | Phase 4 enhancements planned

**Summary:** Additional enhancements to the universe management system. The core universe management features are complete—universe entity type, Universes tab in Control Center, Statistics integration, Guide tab documentation, Create Universe wizard, and context menu actions. These enhancements add power-user features for advanced workflows.

**Current Implementation (Complete):**

- Universe as first-class entity type (`cr_type: universe`)
- UniverseService with CRUD operations, aggregation, orphan detection
- Universes tab in Control Center (conditional visibility)
- Create Universe wizard with guided setup
- Statistics → Universes section with entity counts and drill-down
- Guide tab → Universe notes documentation
- Context menu: "Add essential universe properties"
- Universes base template with 12 pre-configured views

**Planned Enhancements:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Universe dashboard | Enhanced overview with visual entity counts, quick access to related entities |
| Universe-scoped filtering | Filter quick switcher and searches by universe |
| Batch operations | Move entities between universes, bulk universe assignment |

**When This Becomes Relevant:**

These enhancements become valuable when users have:
- Multiple universes with many entities each
- Need to reorganize entities between universes
- Want streamlined navigation within a single universe context

See [Universe Management Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/universe-management.md) for implementation details.

### Custom Relationships on Canvas Trees

**Priority:** 💡 Low — Worldbuilder feature for non-biological lineages

**Status:** Planning

**Summary:** Render custom relationships (defined in the `relationships` frontmatter array) as labeled edges on canvas trees and family charts. Currently, only biological and step/adoptive parent relationships appear on trees. Custom relationship types like vampire sire/childer, guild master/apprentice, or magical bonds are tracked in the Relationships tab but don't render on visual trees.

**Use Cases:**
- **Vampire lineages:** Sire/childer relationships forming parallel "family" structures
- **Guild apprenticeships:** Master/apprentice lineages in fantasy worldbuilding
- **Magical bonds:** Familiar bonds, mentor relationships, magical adoption
- **Feudal systems:** Lord/vassal relationships, sworn sword bonds
- **Non-biological kinship:** Godparents, sworn siblings, adopted-but-not-legally relationships

**Current Workaround:** Users can configure property aliases (`sire` → `father`) to render custom lineages using the standard parent/child infrastructure, but edges display as generic parent/child rather than with custom labels.

**Proposed Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Parse `relationships` array | FamilyGraphBuilder reads `relationships` frontmatter entries |
| Filter by relationship category | Only render relationships marked as "lineage" or "parent-child" type |
| Custom edge labels | Display relationship type on edge (e.g., "sire", "mentor") |
| Edge styling | Distinct styling for custom vs biological relationships (color, dash pattern) |
| Tree wizard option | Checkbox to include/exclude custom relationships from tree generation |

**Technical Approach:**
1. Integrate `RelationshipService` with `FamilyGraphBuilder`
2. Add relationship category property (lineage, peer, association) to custom relationship types
3. When generating trees, include "lineage" category relationships as parent/child edges
4. Apply custom edge styling based on relationship type

### Calendarium Integration

**Priority:** 💡 Low — Unified timeline experience for fictional worldbuilders

**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 complete (v0.12.0) | ✅ Phase 2 complete (v0.15.2) | Phases 3-4 planned

**Summary:** Integration with the [Calendarium](https://plugins.javalent.com/calendarium) plugin to share calendar definitions, eliminating duplicate configuration for worldbuilders. Designed to be invisible to users who don't need it—settings default to off, and no UI changes appear unless Calendarium is installed.

**User Feedback (December 2024):**
- Calendar definition is the main value—users want Calendarium for setting up calendar structure (dates, eras), not primarily for events
- Date ranges (`fc-date` + `fc-end`) are important for lifespans, reign periods, residences
- Pain points with Calendarium include era handling and per-calendar frontmatter fields
- Phase 1 (read-only calendar import) validated as the right starting point

**Integration Modes:**

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Standalone | Canvas Roots manages its own calendars | Users without Calendarium |
| Calendarium Primary | Canvas Roots reads Calendarium calendars | Existing Calendarium users |
| Bidirectional | Full sync between both plugins | Power users wanting unified experience |

**Phased Approach:**
- ✅ **Phase 1 (v0.12.0):** Import calendar definitions from Calendarium—delivers ~80% of value
- ✅ **Phase 2 (v0.15.2):** Display Calendarium events on Canvas Roots timelines; support date ranges (`fc-end`)
- **Phase 3:** Bidirectional sync between plugins
- **Phase 4:** Cross-calendar date translation

**Phase 1 Implementation (v0.12.0):**
- Detects Calendarium plugin installation
- Imports calendar definitions (names, eras, abbreviations, year directions)
- Displays imported calendars in Date Systems card and Create Event modal
- Graceful fallback when Calendarium not installed
- Integrations card hidden when Calendarium not installed

See [Fictional Date Systems - Calendarium Integration](Fictional-Date-Systems#calendarium-integration) for usage documentation.

**Data Mapping (Planned for Phase 3+):**

| Canvas Roots Field | Calendarium Field |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| `fictional_date` | `fc-date` / `fc-start` |
| `fictional_date_end` | `fc-end` |
| `calendar_system` | `fc-calendar` |
| `event_category` | `fc-category` |
| `display_name` | `fc-display-name` |

**Settings:**
- `calendariumIntegration`: off / read-only (bidirectional planned for Phase 3)

**API Integration:** Uses `window.Calendarium` global when available, with graceful fallback when Calendarium is not installed.

**Future Consideration:** Per-calendar frontmatter fields (e.g., `mycalendar-date` instead of `fc-calendar` + `fc-date`) to allow one note to have dates across multiple calendars.

See [Calendarium Integration Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/calendarium-integration.md) for implementation details.

### Transcript Nodes & Oral History

**Priority:** 💡 Low — Specialized for oral history researchers

**Summary:** Time-stamped citations from audio/video with direct linking.

**Schema:**
```yaml
oral_facts:
  - media: "[[Interview with Grandma.mp3]]"
    timestamp: "1m30s"
    fact_type: birth_date
    quote: "I was born on May 15th, 1922"
```

**Features:**
- Deep links with timestamp: `[[Interview.mp3]]#t=1m30s`
- Range support: `#t=1m30s-2m15s`
- One-click playback from timestamp
- Transcript nodes with speech bubble styling on canvas

**Interview Subject Graph:**
- Map relationship structure of interviews
- Interview as central hub node
- Edge thickness indicates mention frequency

---

## Future Considerations

These features are under consideration but not yet prioritized.

### Ghost Nodes for Unresolved Links

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — Visualize incomplete data structures

**Summary:** Display "ghost" or "stub" nodes on canvases for wikilinks in relationship fields that don't resolve to existing notes or notes lacking a `cr_id`. This allows users to visualize the complete intended structure of their family tree or world even when some notes are incomplete or missing.

**Use Cases:**
- **Work-in-progress trees:** See the full intended structure while still creating notes
- **GEDCOM import preview:** Visualize what the tree would look like before all notes are created
- **Research planning:** Show known relationships to people you haven't researched yet
- **Worldbuilding:** Visualize mentioned-but-not-yet-documented characters, places, or organizations

**Scope:** All entity types (people, places, organizations, events).

**Features:**
- Parse wikilinks in relationship fields (father, mother, spouse, parent_place, etc.) that don't resolve to files
- Display stub nodes with distinct styling (dashed borders, muted colors, or "?" indicator)
- Show inferred context on ghost nodes (e.g., if referenced as "father", display "Father of [X]")
- Click-to-create action: clicking a ghost node offers to create the note with pre-filled relationships

**Technical Approach:**
1. During canvas generation, collect all wikilinks from relationship fields
2. Check each link against resolved files and `cr_id` mappings
3. For unresolved links, create placeholder nodes with ghost styling
4. Populate ghost nodes with relationship context inferred from the referencing property

### Research Tracking

Advanced research workflow tools for serious genealogists:

- "Needs research" tags with to-dos
- Confidence levels: verified, probable, possible
- Source documentation per fact
- DNA match tracking
- Research log notes

### Dynasty Management

Tools for tracking succession and inheritance in worldbuilding:

- Line of succession calculator
- Title/position inheritance rules
- Regnal numbering
- Heir designation and succession events

### Sensitive Field Redaction

Automatically redact sensitive personal information (SSN, identity numbers) from exports, regardless of living/deceased status. Currently, sensitive fields imported via GEDCOM v2 are stored but should never appear in exports.

### Inclusive Identity & Privacy Enhancements

Extend the privacy system to better support inclusive identity management:

- **Pronouns field** - Add `pronouns` property (e.g., "she/her", "they/them") for respectful communication in reports and UI
- **Underscore-prefix privacy convention** - Treat fields prefixed with `_` (e.g., `_previous_names`, `_medical_notes`) as private/sensitive:
  - Exclude from person picker and search results
  - Exclude from canvas labels
  - Require confirmation before including in exports
- **Deadname protection** - Automatic suppression of `_previous_names` in display contexts while preserving for historical research
- **Export privacy warnings** - Show confirmation dialog when exporting data containing private fields

This builds on the existing `sex`/`gender`/`gender_identity` data model documented in [Specialized Features](../docs/developer/implementation/specialized-features.md#privacy-and-gender-identity-protection).

### Data Analysis Scope Expansion

Expand Data Quality → Data Analysis scope options beyond folder-based filtering to include note type filtering:

**Current scope options:**
- All records (main tree)
- Staging folder only

**Proposed additions:**
- Filter by note type (Person, Place, Event, Source, etc.)
- Combined folder + note type filtering
- Note-type-specific validations (e.g., place notes check for missing coordinates, person notes check for missing birth date)

This requires generalizing the `DataQualityIssue` interface to support multiple note types instead of just `PersonNode`.

### Person Note Templates

Pre-configured templates for different use cases: Researcher (full fields with sources), Casual User (minimal), World-Builder (with universe/fictional dates), Quick Add (bare minimum).

### Accessibility

- Screen reader support with ARIA labels
- High contrast mode
- Keyboard navigation
- WCAG AA compliance

### Obsidian Publish Support

Static HTML/SVG tree generation for Publish sites with privacy-aware export.

---

## Known Limitations

See [known-limitations.md](known-limitations.md) for complete details.

**Key Limitations:**
- Single vault only (no multi-vault merging)
- No undo/redo for Bases edits (platform limitation)
- No bulk operations from Bases multi-select (platform limitation)
- Privacy obfuscation for canvas display not yet implemented
- Interactive Canvas features limited by Obsidian Canvas API

### Context Menu Submenu Behavior

On desktop, submenus don't dismiss when hovering over a different submenu. This is a limitation of Obsidian's native `Menu` API. Potential solutions (flattening menus, modal dialogs, custom menu component) are under consideration based on user feedback.
