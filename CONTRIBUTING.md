It covers the `src/` modules (sources, events, maps, places, organizations, relationships, dates, schemas, statistics, reports, universes, trees, dynamic content, UI), command registration, context menus, and Control Center tabs.

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development

1. **Start watch mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Watch CSS changes** (in separate terminal)
   ```bash
   npm run build:css:watch
   ```

3. **Make changes** to TypeScript or CSS files

4. **Deploy to test vault**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

5. **Reload Obsidian** (Ctrl/Cmd + R)

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Stable releases only
- Feature branches: `feature/description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/description`
- Documentation: `docs/description`

### Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines:

- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Use imperative mood: "Fix bug" not "Fixes bug"
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Reference issues: "Fix #123: Description"
- **Never mention AI tools or assistants** in commit messages

**Format:**
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or tooling changes

**Examples:**
```
feat: Add GEDCOM import functionality

Implements basic GEDCOM file parsing and person note creation.
Supports GEDCOM 5.5.1 format.

Closes #42
```

```
fix: Correct node positioning on canvas

Fixes an issue where nodes were positioned incorrectly when
the root person had no parents.

Fixes #57
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Follow the ESLint configuration ([.eslintrc.json](.eslintrc.json))
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Avoid `any` types when possible

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Generates a unique identifier for a person node.
 * @returns A UUID v4 string
 */
function generatePersonId(): string {
  return crypto.randomUUID();
}
```

### CSS

- Follow the Stylelint configuration ([.stylelintrc.json](.stylelintrc.json))
- Use BEM naming with `cr-` prefix
- Prefer CSS variables over hard-coded values
- Use Obsidian's CSS variables for theme compatibility
- See [docs/developer/css-system.md](docs/developer/css-system.md) for details

**Example:**
```css
.cr-person-node {
  width: var(--cr-node-width);
  background: var(--background-primary);
  color: var(--text-normal);
}

.cr-person-node__name {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.cr-person-node--highlighted {
  border-color: var(--interactive-accent);
}
```

### Code Style

Run linting before committing:

```bash
# TypeScript linting
npm run lint

# CSS linting
npm run lint:css

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:fix
npm run lint:css:fix
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Create test data**
   - Create person notes with various relationships
   - Test with different family structures
   - Include edge cases (orphans, adoptions, multiple spouses)

2. **Test scenarios**
   - Generate tree from person note
   - Re-layout existing canvas
   - GEDCOM import/export (when implemented)
   - Settings changes
   - Theme switching (light/dark)
   - Mobile compatibility

3. **Performance testing**
   - Test with large family trees (100+ people)
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check layout calculation speed

### Automated Testing

Charted Roots uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit and regression
tests. The suite lives in [`tests/`](tests/) and currently covers
date parsing, relationship traversal, wikilink resolution, event sorting,
GEDCOM round-trips, the bidirectional-linker, and various utility
helpers.

#### Running tests

```bash
# Run the whole suite once
npm test

# Watch mode — reruns on file change
npm run test:watch

# Run a single file (or a name fragment that matches a file)
npm test -- conflict-policy
```

#### Where tests live

- One file per unit under test in [`tests/`](tests/), named
  `<subject>.test.ts`. Examples:
  [`tests/conflict-policy.test.ts`](tests/conflict-policy.test.ts),
  [`tests/relationship-query-service.test.ts`](tests/relationship-query-service.test.ts),
  [`tests/extract-display-label.test.ts`](tests/extract-display-label.test.ts).
- Regression tests are named by the bug they fence: e.g.,
  [`tests/sort-order-range-kind.test.ts`](tests/sort-order-range-kind.test.ts)
  (the v0.22.46 #569 follow-up).

#### What to test

- **Pure helpers** — anything that takes plain data and returns plain
  data (parsers, formatters, sort comparators, policy resolvers). These
  are the easiest tests to write and the most durable.
- **Regression coverage for shipped bugs** — when fixing a bug, add a
  test that reproduces it. Name the file after the symptom or the issue
  number so future readers can find it.
- **Input-contract fuzz** — for helpers that take varied input shapes
  (e.g., wikilinks, date strings), enumerate the shapes you've seen in
  the wild so the next variant gets caught by tests rather than by a
  reporter. Pattern reference:
  [`tests/person-note-writer-smart-wikilink.test.ts`](tests/person-note-writer-smart-wikilink.test.ts)
  (the v0.22.28 #548 corpus).

#### What we typically *don't* unit-test

- **Obsidian-API-heavy code paths** (modals, views, services that lean
  on `App`/`Vault`/`MetadataCache`). The mocking scaffold is heavy, and
  these are usually verified manually in the dev-vault. Examples:
  the `ConflictGuardModal` modal itself, `FamilyChartView` rendering,
  `data-quality-batch-ops` interactive flows.
- **Visual rendering** (canvas layouts, SVG overlays). Verified by
  reloading the plugin in the dev-vault.

#### When you add a new test file

- Mirror the surrounding style: one `describe` per public surface,
  `it` blocks that read as full sentences ("returns null for
  unparseable input").
- Reference the issue or symptom in a short comment at the top of the
  file so a future reader can tell why each suite exists.
- Run `npm test` locally before pushing — CI runs the same gate.

## Documentation

### When to Update Documentation

Update documentation when:

- Adding new features
- Changing existing functionality
- Fixing bugs that affect user workflow
- Adding new configuration options
- Changing plugin architecture

### Documentation Standards

Follow the [Documentation Style Guide](docs/assets/templates/documentation-style-guide.md):

- Use kebab-case for file names
- Include table of contents for long documents
- Use descriptive headings
- Add code examples for complex features
- Include screenshots for UI features
- Use second person ("you") when addressing users
- Avoid using "we" or "our"

### Documentation Types

- **User Guides**: How to use features
- **Developer Docs**: Technical implementation details
- **API Reference**: Public API documentation
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step walkthroughs

## Internationalization

Translation support is **post-1.0** — the UI surface is still being
stabilized for the 1.0 release, and starting infrastructure work now
would compound rework as strings continue to change.

The central tracking thread is
[Discussion #594](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/discussions/594),
which covers framework choice, string extraction, locale detection,
and the translator workflow. If you'd like to translate Charted Roots
into your language, **comment on the discussion** with the language
code (e.g., `zh-CN`, `de`, `fr`) and a brief intro. You'll be
@-mentioned once the infrastructure is ready for translation work.

Please do not open PRs that add a translation framework or extract
strings ahead of the design conversation — coordinate in
[#594](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/discussions/594)
first so the eventual implementation is consistent across languages.
